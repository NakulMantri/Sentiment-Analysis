5,"I wanted to buy yellow colour but that was not delivering on my pin code so went for this colour.After receiving this, I have no regression.Love this.iPhone heats a lot because of its built.

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider when comparing it to Android phones.One of the biggest cons of the iPhone 14 is its lack of customization options.

5,"Camera and Display are good. Battery lasts for one day for medium usage. Overall Apple is good in hardware. Moving from Android hence taking time to get used to iOS. Some features in Android are better like swipe on side to move back, notifications swipe down from anywhere in the screen instead in iOS have to go all the way to top and swipe down to pull notifications. For now Android user experience is better. Don't know if it will change after getting used to iOS.",Karthick P

Beautiful screen that is much brighter in day light and shows true-to-life colors.3. Speaker throws out a richer base-er sound along with crisp higher frequency sounds.4. Camera is much better with controls and light sensitivity. I skipped 13 especially for the photonic engine. Low light performance is so much mo...,Gowrish Prabhu

5,It's just like iPhone 13. No significant jump. But I upgraded from 11 so feels better than that. But iPhone continues it's adamant stance of not providing a file manager and app drawer. It's not flexible like Android. Only reason u should buy an iPhone is security. It's miles ahead of Android on terms of data privacy and security,Dr Manjunath Giriyappa
5,"Android is far far better than iPhones. It doesn't have fingerprint when you want to open your mobile during night. It doesn't even scan your face and finding very difficult to type the pin every time irritates a lot. The only best thing about this mobile is camera and all the other thing feels very complicated. and regarding the space it feels faster and it's only been 15 days since I bought it and half of the space has already been filled. if you really are buyer of iPhones, please go for m...",Pooja
