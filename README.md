# Steps

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Load the dataset using pandas.**
2. **Check for and remove duplicate rows.**
3. **Handle missing values, if any.**

## Text Cleaning
1. **Define a function to clean reviews by removing special characters, stopwords, and applying lemmatization.**
2. **Clean each review in the dataset.**

## Dynamic Feature Extraction
1. **Define a function to extract dynamic features from reviews, such as noun phrases.**
